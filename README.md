# Java Collections Framework üöÄ

This repository provides examples and implementations of the Java Collections Framework, a powerful set of interfaces and classes that offer reusable collection data structures. It serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and effectively utilizing various collection types in Java. This project aims to provide a practical understanding of how to leverage these collections in real-world applications.

üí° **Project Description:**

The Java Collections Framework is a cornerstone of Java development, providing a standardized way to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects. This project is designed to help developers, from beginners to experienced programmers, master the concepts and implementations of the framework's core components. It offers clear examples and practical demonstrations of how to use each collection type effectively.

‚úÖ **Key Features:**

*   ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes detailed examples of List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces and their implementations.
*   üåü **Practical Examples:** Demonstrates real-world usage scenarios for each collection type, making it easier to understand their applications.
*   ‚ú® **Clear Explanations:** Provides concise explanations of the key concepts and features of the Java Collections Framework.
*   üìö **Well-Organized Structure:** The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and quick access to specific collection types.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Ready-to-Use Code:** Includes runnable code examples that can be easily adapted for your own projects.

‚¨áÔ∏è **Installation Guide:**

To set up the Java Collections Framework examples locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
    *   A Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SurajGupta2k/Java-Collection-Framework.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Java-Collection-Framework
    ```
4.  **Compile the Code:**
    ```bash
    javac src/**/*.java
    ```
5.  **Run the Examples:**
    *   Navigate to `src` folder
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
    *   To run specific example run the .java file
    ```bash
    java list/ArrayListExample.java
    ```

üé¨ **Usage Examples:**

Here are a few examples of how to use the Java Collections Framework:

1.  **ArrayList Example:**
    ```java
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;

    public class ArrayListExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
            names.add("Alice");
            names.add("Bob");
            names.add("Charlie");

            System.out.println("Names: " + names); // Output: Names: [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **HashSet Example:**
    ```java
    import java.util.HashSet;
    import java.util.Set;

    public class HashSetExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>();
            numbers.add(1);
            numbers.add(2);
            numbers.add(3);
            numbers.add(1); // Duplicate, will be ignored

            System.out.println("Numbers: " + numbers); // Output: Numbers: [1, 2, 3]
        }
    }
    ```

üíª **Technology Stack:**

*   ‚òï **Java:** The primary programming language used for implementing the collection framework examples. Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
